## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The system is **production-ready** and can be:
1. **Tested locally** (http://localhost:5000)
2. **Demonstrated at hackathon** (works perfectly for judges)
3. **Deployed online** (with proper WSGI server like Gunicorn)
4. **Extended** (architecture supports adding more modules)

---

## 📞 If Something Breaks

1. **Check Flask console** for errors with `[M1]`, `[M2]`, `[M3]` tags
2. **Open browser DevTools** (F12) and check Console for JavaScript errors
3. **Restart Flask**: Ctrl+C then `python app.py`
4. **Check file permissions**: uploads/ folder must be writable
5. **Verify Python version**: Should be 3.8+
6. **Check dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
