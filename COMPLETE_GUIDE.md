---

## 🚀 RUN THE APPLICATION

```bash
cd d:\Others\Hackathon\GDG
python app.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

---

## 👤 LOGIN CREDENTIALS

## 📊 THREE MODULES EXPLAINED

### **Module 1 - Document Grouping & Duplicate Detection (M1)**
```
Input:  Upload .txt, .pdf, or .docx file
Process: Analyzes document content, compares similarity
Output: UNIQUE or DUPLICATE_RISK (0-100% confidence)
Time:   1-3 seconds
```

**How it works:**
- Cleans and tokenizes document text
- Builds similarity matrix using Hashing Vectorizer
- Groups similar documents together
- Flags duplicates or suspicious copies

**When to use:**
- Detect plagiarism submissions
- Find duplicate documents in archives
- Organize document collections

---

### **Module 2 - AI vs Human Text Detection (M2)**
```
Input:  Upload .txt, .pdf, or .docx file
Process: Analyzes linguistic patterns, statistical signatures
Output: HUMAN_TEXT or AI_TEXT (0-100% confidence)
Time:   5-15 seconds (first run), 2-3s (cached)
```

**How it works:**
- Extracts text from file (supports OCR for scanned PDFs)
- Calculates GPT-2 model probabilities
- Analyzes surprise (entropy), burstiness, human noise
- Combines scores to determine origin

**When to use:**
- Detect ChatGPT/Claude written essays
- Verify writing authenticity
- Quality assurance for content

---

### **Module 3 - AI / Deepfake Image Detection (M3)**
```
Input:  Upload .jpg, .png, or .jpeg file
Process: Forensic analysis + semantic understanding
Output: REAL or AI_GENERATED (0-100% confidence)
Time:   3-8 seconds (first run), 1-2s (cached)
```

**How it works:**
- Analyzes entropy (compression patterns)
- Performs FFT frequency analysis
- Checks EXIF metadata (real photos have it)
- Uses CLIP model for semantic understanding
- Combines forensics + AI for hybrid detection

**When to use:**
- Detect AI-generated faces (Midjourney, DALL-E)
- Identify deepfakes
- Verify photo authenticity
- Content moderation

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Processing..." forever | Model downloading | Wait 30-60s, check terminal |
| File won't upload | Wrong file type | Use .txt/.pdf/.docx for M1/M2, .jpg/.png for M3 |
| Email not received | Wrong email address | Use real Gmail address when registering |
| Admin login fails | Wrong credentials | Email: `admin@local`, Password: `AdminPass123` |
| Port 5000 in use | Another app running | Kill process: `lsof -i :5000` then `kill -9 <PID>` |
| Module import error | Files in wrong folder | M1.py, M2.py, M3.py must be in same folder as app.py |

## 📈 PERFORMANCE METRICS

**Typical Response Times:**

| Module | First Run | Cached |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| M1 (Document) | 1-3s | 1-3s |
| M2 (Text) | 5-15s | 2-3s |
| M3 (Image) | 3-8s | 1-2s |

**Why slow first time?**
- PyTorch/Transformers initialize
- ML models downloaded (100-500MB)
- GPU/CUDA initialization
- Subsequent runs use cache (much faster)

**Concurrent Users:**
- SQLite supports ~5-10 simultaneous
- For production: migrate to PostgreSQL
- Stateless design = easy scaling
