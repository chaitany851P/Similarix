# Testing Guide - M1 Multiple Files & Progress Messages (Updated Message 10)

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **M1 Now Accepts Multiple Documents (Folder Logic)**
- **Before**: Only accepted single .txt/.pdf/.docx file
- **After**: Accepts 2+ documents at once, compares them for duplicates
- **How**: Upload as folder by selecting multiple files in file picker

### 2. **Real Progress Messages Now Display**
- **Before**: Clicking "Analyze" showed nothing until result
- **After**: Shows "⏳ Processing..." with:
  - Module name (DUPLICATE, TEXT ANALYSIS, IMAGE DETECTION)
  - File count and file names
  - Status: "Analyzing with AI models..."
  - Spinner animation

### 3. **Email Reports Sent Automatically**
- **Before**: No confirmation user got email
- **After**: Shows "✉️ Email report sent" after analysis
- **Also**: Admin can see all emails sent in Logs

### **TEST 2: M1 - Multiple Document Upload (NEW)**

**Purpose**: Test M1 with 2-3 documents to verify duplicate detection

#### Step A: Create Test Documents
1. Create 2-3 text files:
   - `doc1.txt`: 
     ```
     This is a document about artificial intelligence.
     AI is transforming the world.
     Machine learning is a key technology.
     ```
   - `doc2.txt`:
     ```
     Artificial intelligence is changing society.
     AI and machine learning are important.
     The future is powered by AI.
     ```
   - `doc3.txt`:
     ```
     Cats are animals. Dogs are also animals.
     Birds can fly. Fish live in water.
     ```

2. **Save all 3 files locally** (e.g., in `Downloads` folder)

#### Step B: Upload to M1
1. On Dashboard, find **Module 1: Document Grouping** card
2. Click **"Choose Files"** button in M1 card
3. Select **ALL 3 files** (Ctrl+Click to multi-select)
4. Click **Open**
5. Files should show as selected
6. Click **Analyze** button

#### Step C: Verify Progress Message
**Watch carefully for:**
- ✅ Loading spinner appears
- ✅ Message shows: `"⏳ Processing... Module: DUPLICATE, Files: 3 (doc1.txt, doc2.txt, doc3.txt)"`
- ✅ After 3-5 seconds, result appears

#### Step D: Check Results
**Expected Result:**
- **Status**: "HAS_DUPLICATES" or similar (since doc1 & doc2 are similar)
- **Confidence**: 65-75% (similarity score)
- **Message**: Shows which documents are grouped together
- **Progress Bar**: Shows confidence as colored bar

**Screenshot moment**: Capture the result showing multiple files analyzed

### **TEST 3: M2 - Single Text File (Verify Still Works)**

2. On Dashboard, find **Module 3: Deepfake Detection**
3. Click **"Choose Images"** button
4. Select **2-3 images** (Ctrl+Click to multi-select)
5. Click **Open**
6. Click **Analyze**

#### Expected:
- ✅ Loading message: `"Module: IMAGE DETECTION, Files: 3 (image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg)"`
- ✅ After 5-10 seconds, result shows

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Nothing happens when I click Analyze"
**Fix:**
1. Open **DevTools** (F12 in Chrome)
2. Click **Console** tab
3. Try analyze again
4. Look for any red error messages
5. Post the error in console

### Issue: "Progress message doesn't show"
**Fix:**
1. Check if file was selected (should show filename)
2. Wait 2-3 seconds (first run downloads AI models)
3. Check DevTools Network tab to see if request was sent

### Issue: "Email not received"
**Fix:**
1. Check Spam/Junk folder
2. Verify email address was typed correctly in signup
3. Check if Flask console shows `[EMAIL] ✓` message

### Issue: "M1 only takes one file"
**Fix (already done, but verify):**
1. Click "Choose Files" button (not "Choose File")
2. Use **Ctrl+Click** to select multiple files
3. All selected files should show in file input

---

## 📊 Expected Console Output (Flask Terminal)

When you run an analysis, Flask terminal should show:

```
[M1] Starting analysis on 3 document(s)
[M1] Reading 3 files...
[M1] ✓ Loaded: doc1.txt
[M1] ✓ Loaded: doc2.txt
[M1] ✓ Loaded: doc3.txt
[M1] Building similarity matrix...
[M1] Grouping documents...
[M1] Result: HAS_DUPLICATES (74%)
[EMAIL] Sending report to test@gmail.com...
[EMAIL] ✓ Report sent successfully
```

## 🎯 Ready for Hackathon?

After passing all 7 tests, your system is ready:
- ✅ Multiple documents analyzed (M1)
- ✅ Real-time feedback to users (Progress messages)
- ✅ Automatic email reports
- ✅ Admin monitoring & user blocking
- ✅ Beautiful Fluent UI with animations

---

## 📝 Notes

- **First run** of each module takes 10-30 seconds (downloads AI models)
- **Subsequent runs** are fast (2-5 seconds) - models cached
- **Large files** (>10MB) may take longer
- **Email testing**: Use your real email to receive reports
- **Admin Email**: `admin@local` (no real mailbox, used for admin features only)
